This code is designed to analyze character frequencies and gender representation within two classic novels, "Pride and Prejudice" and "War and Peace." It divides the analysis into two parts, initially focusing on two-part character names and then on one-part names. The code tokenizes the text, removes common words, and generates frequency tables for the most significant characters. It also breaks the text into 3000-word chunks for character analysis. Additionally, it explores gender representation by examining names used for both men and women. The project provides insights into character importance and gender balance trends throughout the novels.
