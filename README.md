This project focuses on character and gender analysis in two classic novels, "Pride and Prejudice" and "War and Peace." The analysis is divided into two parts: firstly, character analysis with a focus on two-part names (e.g., "Lady Bennet"), and secondly, character analysis with one-part names (e.g., "Kate" or "Bennette"). The code tokenizes the text, filters out stopwords, and generates frequency tables for the top characters. Additionally, it divides the text into 3000-word chunks for character dominance analysis. The project also explores gender dominance by analyzing names used for both men and women. The README provides an overview of the code's functions and the insights it offers into character and gender dynamics within the novels, revealing trends in character prominence and gender balance throughout the texts.
